# Airline_Analytics_SQL_Python

This project uses SQL and Python to analyze airline data in order to identify opportunities to increase occupancy rate.

# Business Problem

The airline industry is facing a number of challenges, including stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, and rising fuel prices. These challenges are putting pressure on profitability, and airlines are looking for ways to increase occupancy rate in order to mitigate the impact of these challenges.

# Main Challenges

Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
Higher flight taxes: To solve environmental issues and increase money, governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs and increased turnover rates.

# Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
Improve pricing strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
Enhance customer experience: We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.
Data.
The data used in this project is a publicly available dataset of airline flights. The dataset includes information on flight dates, departure and arrival airports, number of passengers, and ticket prices.

# Methods

The methods used in this project include:

Data cleaning: The data was cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
Exploratory data analysis: The data was analyzed to identify trends and patterns.
Statistical modeling: Statistical models were used to predict occupancy rate.

# Results

The results of the project showed that there are a number of factors that can affect occupancy rate, including:

The time of year
The day of the week
The origin and destination airports
The price of tickets
The number of competitors
The project also developed a number of recommendations for increasing occupancy rate, such as:

Adjusting ticket prices based on demand
Targeting marketing campaigns to specific demographics
Improving the customer experience
Conclusion
This project has shown that it is possible to increase occupancy rate by using SQL and Python to analyze airline data. The results of the project can be used by airlines to improve their profitability and competitiveness.

# Future Work

This project could be extended in a number of ways, such as:

Using more advanced statistical models
Analyzing data from other sources, such as social media
Developing a web application to make the results of the project more accessible.
